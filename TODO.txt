Stuff that needs to be done:

Notes that need to go somewhere, I am not sure where.

For anyone who uses a microphone, (presenters, chair, MC...)
Don't clap near the mic, don't clap when you are holding a mic.      
The audience and the audio system does not need to hear CLAP CLAP CLAP!!!
I think we need one of the cards to say this, along with "Spean into the mic" and "Don't use the mic as a pointer."
