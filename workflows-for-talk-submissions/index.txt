Workflows for Talk Submissions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Allow talks to have different lengths.  For example:

*   20 minutes
*   50 minutes
*   110 minutes

More generally, we want to be able to control the lengths of talks
without code changes.

----

Allow talks to have numerous presenters.  Make sure that if two or three
people are working on a talk together, then all of them get emails sent
by the system during the approval process.

----

The current model involves voting +1, +0, -0, -1 on each talk.  This is
problematic because it lead to many talks with tied scores.  I'm not
sure how to avoid this, but maybe we encourage each voter to rank the
talks from top to bottom.
