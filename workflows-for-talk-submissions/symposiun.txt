Using public facing pages, 
prospective presenters create accounts and submit talk proposals.

Using the shell?
$ python manage.py create_review_permissions
reviews | reviews | Can review Tutorials
reviews | reviews | Can manage Tutorials
reviews | reviews | Can review General Sessions
reviews | reviews | Can manage General Sessions

Reviewers create accounts, admin adds them to the reviewer group (how?)

Reviewers go to site's  /dashboard/ page.  
... (Reviews are not needed to accept a talk.)

staff goes to site's  /dashboard/ page.  
here is the definition of staff:  admin = request.user.is_staff
https://github.com/pinax/symposion/blob/master/symposion/reviews/views.py#L184

select a talk, hit "accept" button.
This will copy the data from proposal to a new presentation:
post (site)/reviews/review/2/?csrfmiddlewaretoken=abc&result_submit=accept
this will happen:

proposal.result.status = "accepted"
proposal.result.save()
https://github.com/pinax/symposion/blob/master/symposion/reviews/views.py#L242

post_save.connect(accepted_proposal, sender=ProposalResult)
  if instance.status == "accepted":
    promote_proposal(instance.proposal)

 presentation = Presentation(
   title = proposal.title, description = proposal.description,...
https://github.com/pinax/symposion/blob/master/symposion/reviews/models.py#L318


Using the django admin, create one or more of the following:
Schedule: (seems it is preloaded from fixtures?)
Slot Kind: "talk" (lower case. seems this should be loaded from fixtures?)
Days: the days of the event
Rooms: the names of the rooms and order they will appear on the schedule
Slots: Select a day, a kind, enter start and end.  (what does Content Overide do?)

Assign the presentation to a slot (either the admin or (site)/schedule/talks/edit/  and then click the PLUS icon, and you should see a pulldown with any
unassigned presentations.
