pyohio-code-of-conduct
=====================

A "fork" of the [PyCon code of conduct](https://github.com/python/pycon-code-of-conduct) including the staff and attendee guides. 

Once blessed by the Conference Chair, or delegate, each year's CoC will live [here](https://www.pyohio.org/code-of-conduct/) on PyOhio.Org.
