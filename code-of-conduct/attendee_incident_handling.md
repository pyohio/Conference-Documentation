This procedure adopted from the Ada Initiative's guide titled "[Conference anti-harassment/Responding to Reports](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports)”.

1\. All conference staff will wear a conference badge with the word “STAFF”. All staff understand our [code of conduct policy](/code-of-conduct/) and [staff guide for handling harassment](/harassment-incident-staff/) at the conference. *We will hold a mandatory staff meeting onsite at the conference to reiterate this.*

2\. Report the harassment incident (preferably in writing) to a conference staff member. All reports remain confidential. Please do not disclose public information about the incident until the staff have had sufficient time to address the situation. This provides for your safety and protection and for that of the other attendees.

When reporting the event to staff, try to gather as much information as available but do not interview people about the incident. Staff will assist you in writing the report/collecting information.

The important information consists of:

- Identifying information (name/badge number) of the participant doing the harassing
- The behavior in violation
- The approximate time of the behavior
- The circumstances surrounding the incident
- Other people involved in the incident

The staff understand how to deal with the incident and how to further proceed with the situation.

3\. If not physical threat exists, involve law enforcement or security only at a victim's request. If you do feel your safety in jeopardy please do not hesitate to contact local law enforcement by dialing 911. If you do not have a cell phone, you can use any local phone or simply ask a staff member.

**Note**: Incidents that violate the Code of Conduct can prove extremely damaging to the community, and we will not tolerate them. A silver lining exists; in many cases, these incidents present a chance for the offenders, and the community at large, to grow, learn, and become better. Please make PyOhio staff your first resource when reporting a PyOhio-related incident, so that we may enforce the [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct/) and take quick action toward a resolution.

If at all possible, make reports directly to [Jason Green](PyOhio@JasonGreen.Name) +1 (614) 349-6349 or [Brian Costlow](foo@bar.baz) at +1 (555) 555-5555.
