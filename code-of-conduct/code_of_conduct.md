PyOhio provides a community conference intended for networking and collaboration in the developer community.

We value the participation of each member of the Python community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, we expect all attendees to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all conference events, whether officially sponsored by PyOhio or not.

All attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, and volunteers at any PyOhio event must conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

The Short Version
-----------------

PyOhio provides a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.

All communication should remain appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. We consider sexual language or imagery inappropriate in any conference venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. We consider harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes inappropriate.

Conference organizers may ask any attendees violating these rules to leave the conference.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

The Longer Version
------------------

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior should comply immediately.

Our anti-harassment policy includes exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can offend those around you. We consider excessive swearing and offensive jokes inappropriate.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference.
