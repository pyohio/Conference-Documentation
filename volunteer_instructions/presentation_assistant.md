    Use same title consistently for presentation assistant,
    subsuming presenter introducer, session chair, and room nag.
    Presentation assistant seems the clearest title to me.

    At the beginning of each day, the organizers should place at the lecterns
    one bottle of water for each presenter.

    Print the following directions on the back sides of the time cards.
    Being a presentation assistant is easy, so I've been able to recruit
    folks _during_ presentations to do it when we were short staffed.
    It would be easier to get them started if what they needed to do was
    written down. The back sides of the time remaining card is a good place for
    this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's what a presentation assistant does.

1. Have a bottle of water for the presenter.

    Hi, I'm <name>. I am your session chair. Here's a bottle of water.
    Let me know if you need anything.
    I'll go take care of it, letting you stay here to get ready.

2. Introduction

    How do you want me to introduce you or do you want to introduct yourself?
    How do you pronounce your name?

3. Lights

    After the presentation starts, turn down or turn off the room lights[1] so
    that the screen is easier to see. You might need to turn on a spot light[2]
    to illuminate the presenter so that video camera can see them.

4. Time Remaining Cards

    You have <insert amount here (50 minutes for PyOhio)> for your presentation.

    I have "15", "10", "5", "0" cards to show you the time remaining.
    (Show the cards to the presenter.)
    After I raise a card to let you know how much time is remaining,
    I'll lower it when you indicate that you've seen it,
    like looking at me or the card and nodding.

    What time do you want the "0" to be for?
    At the actual ending time, or 5 or 10 minutes earlier for questions?

5. Repeat Questions

    When someone in the audience asks a question,
    please repeat it so that it gets recorded in the video.

    Alternatively, the presentation assistant can bring a microphone to each
    person with a question. That reduces time wasted by presenter repeating the
    question.

5. GTFO

    When the time is up, and you want to continue talking with folks about
    the presentation, tell them that you are moving to an "open space",
    then leave the room so that the next presenter can get ready.

    The presentation assistant's most important task is to get the presenter
    out of the room at the end of their allotted time, so that the conference
    stays on schedule.

[1] For the Cartoon 1 and Cartoon 2 rooms at the Ohio Union, the room lights
    are at the back of the room close to the doors. Both sides are turned on or
    off at the same time.

[2] For the Cartoon 1 and Cartoon 2 rooms at the Ohio Union, there was a slider
    dimmer on the wall near the lectern for spotlights that illuminate the
    presenter and unfortunately, also the screen.

tips

    Time Remaining Cards

        Put one's cell phone in vibrate mode,
        then set alarm for when to show first card.
        When alarm goes off,
        select "slumber" so that alarm goes off in another five minutes.

tips from AV:

Try to do things in this order:

1. Get the mic on the presenter asap.   The sooner it is on them, the
better.  If there is a problem, the sooner we know about it the
better, and some of the problems become apparent after a min or two,
like head set not hooked to ear correctly and falls off, or it shifts
and starts rubbing against a beard, or a clip on mic  gets it by a
swinging name tag.    We want to know about that as they are fiddling
with projector res, not after their talk has started.

2. Sound check - get them to say "hello room!" in a somewhat
normal voice until it comes over the PA.  It should take about 10
seconds.  This is more to confirm everything is functional:  mic
exists, is in place, is on, batteries are not dead, mic is not muted, 
and all the equipment between mic and speakers is working.  
The fine adjustments can happen when they actually start talking.

Presentation assistant should use a mic any time they are addressing 
the room, not just for things that are to be recoreded.  
The more audio the sound board operator has to
work with the better. 

3. If there are any event specific announcements to make, do those before 
the introduction.  The recording should start with what the talk is about, not a change in the lunch schedule. 

4. Confirm the presenter(s) are really ready to go.

5. Confirm Video recording folk are ready, which is pretty much make eye
contact with them. Typically they will be watching the front of the
room for the talk to start.  If they are not ready they will be heads
down playing with things and it will probably be apparent they are not
ready. 

6. Introduce the presenter. 
The intro will be recorded, I hope.  It makes a nice start, and helps
identify what the heck is going on later if there are problems.  "This
is bob, he is going to talk about foo."

Ideally there is a mic on a stand people queue up behind.

That takes an extra 10-20 min of setup per room, so I nixed it due not
having enough setup time.


Lights - mixed feelings about what to say.  Not sure turning them down
is always best.  video likes light, the spots were somewhat orange and
dim.  Not sure what the attendees in the room think.

Remember that one of the goals is to make the repo public a little later this fall, and open source the doc for use by other small conferences.

In that light, it makes sense to separate data that is generally useful, such as:

"At the beginning of each day, the organizers should place at the lecterns
    one bottle of water for each presenter."

From stuff that is Ohio Union specific:

" For the Cartoon 1 and Cartoon 2 rooms at the Ohio Union, the room lights
    are at the back of the room close to the doors. Both sides are turned on or
    off at the same time."

By putting them in separate, related docs that reference each other.
